# About

In this project I have created a sentence similarity score calculator which takes two sentences as input and shows their corresponding similarity score which shows show similar the sentences are. The more close to 1 the score is the more similar the sentences are, the close to 0 the score is the more dissilimar the sentences are.

Due to large size of the word2vec model, the model could not be deployed at heroku.
